# My-Code-Generator
The purpose of this project is to create a password generator that gives random passwords based on User input. 
The random passwords can consist of numerical, alphabetic and symbol characters.
In this project the HTML code and CSS stylesheet were already provided. 
So, my only task was to add additional code to the script.js file.

## Usage

To use the Password Generator, the user is given a simple web interface titled Password Generator with a textbox and a red  button labled Generate Password. 

The User presses the button labled Generate Password and is then prompted/ asked several questions to define the parameters of their desired password. 

Once the User selects at least one criteria for their desired passowrd a password will be  generated. If not the User will be prompted to once again to make a selection and directed to pick at least one option.

Below is a couple of screen shots on how I planned to structure the Javascript code within the project and a screenshot of the first alert or message that the user will see once clicking the Generate Pasword button.
